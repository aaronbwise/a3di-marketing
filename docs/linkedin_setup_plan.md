# A3DI LinkedIn Setup & Launch Plan

> A step-by-step checklist for setting up LinkedIn as A3DI's primary marketing channel — tailored for a solo consultant with a full-time university day job.

---

## Pre-Work: Before You Touch LinkedIn

### Step 0: Check Your Employment Terms
- [ ] Review your university employment contract for any outside work / conflict of interest clauses
- [ ] If a disclosure form is required, complete and submit it (humanitarian data consulting almost never conflicts with university work, but get it on paper)
- [ ] Confirm you will only use personal devices and accounts for A3DI work

**Why this matters:** Once this is sorted, you can post freely without second-guessing yourself. Do this first so it's never a nagging concern.

## Phase 1: Personal Profile Overhaul (Week 1)

Your personal profile is your primary marketing engine. Company pages get a fraction of the reach. Invest your time here.

### Step 1.1: Update Your Headline
- [ ] Go to your profile → click the pencil icon next to your name
- [ ] Replace your current headline with something like:

> **Data & Evidence Specialist for Humanitarian Organisations | Survey Design, Data Pipelines & Dashboards | 15 Years Across Africa & Asia**

**Tips:**
- Lead with what you do for clients, not your job title
- Include keywords your target audience would search for (M&E, humanitarian, data pipelines)
- Do NOT mention the university here — this is your A3DI shop window
- 220 character max — use most of it

### Step 1.2: Rewrite Your About Section
- [ ] Go to your profile → About → edit
- [ ] Write in first person, conversational tone
- [ ] Use this structure:

**Paragraph 1 — Who you help:**
> I work with UN agencies, NGOs, and development organisations that need to get more from their data — whether that's designing better surveys, building automated pipelines, or turning complex datasets into clear dashboards and reports.

**Paragraph 2 — What you bring:**
> Over the past 15 years, I've worked on data projects across Africa and Asia in the food security, nutrition, and social protection sectors. I've seen what works (and what doesn't) when it comes to evidence-based programme design — from field data collection through to donor reporting.

**Paragraph 3 — How you work / CTA:**
> Through A3DI, I offer hands-on support across the full evidence pathway: survey design and implementation, data analysis and pipeline development, visualisation (Tableau, PowerBI), and capacity-building training for your team. If your organisation is looking for practical, experienced data support, I'd welcome a conversation.
>
> Book a free 30-minute consultation: [Calendly link]
> Or reach me at: [email]

**Tips:**
- Keep it under 2,000 characters (about 300 words)
- Avoid buzzwords: no "synergy", "leverage", "passionate about"
- End with a specific CTA — a Calendly link is ideal

### Step 1.3: Update Your Experience Section
- [ ] **Add your university role** (fills the timeline gap — a gap looks worse than a day job):

> **[Your Title]** · [University Name]
> [Start Date] – Present
> *(No description needed — keep it minimal)*

- [ ] **Add A3DI as a concurrent current role** (LinkedIn allows multiple current positions):

> **Founder & Lead Consultant** · A3DI
> [Start Date] – Present
>
> Helping development and humanitarian organisations use data to generate evidence-based, actionable insights. Services include:
> • Survey design and implementation (paper, tablet, and web)
> • Data analysis, pipeline development, and management
> • Dashboards (Tableau, PowerBI) and programme reporting
> • Training and capacity building for M&E and data teams
>
> Sectors: Food security, nutrition, social protection
> Regions: East & West Africa, South & Southeast Asia
> www.a3di.dev

- [ ] **Drag A3DI above the university role** in the profile editor so it appears first
- [ ] Ensure previous UN/NGO roles are listed with at least titles and organisations (these build credibility)

### Step 1.4: Set Up Your Featured Section
- [ ] Go to your profile → "Add profile section" → "Recommended" → "Add featured"
- [ ] Add 2–3 items (in this priority order):
  1. **Link to a3di.dev** with a short description
  2. **A case study PDF** once you have one formalised (revisit in Phase 3)
  3. **Your best LinkedIn post** once you have traction (revisit in Month 2+)

### Step 1.5: Add Skills & Get Endorsements
- [ ] Add these skills (they affect search visibility):
  - Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
  - Survey Design
  - Data Analysis
  - Data Management
  - Tableau / Power BI
  - Food Security
  - Programme Management
  - Humanitarian Response
  - Capacity Building
  - Statistical Analysis
- [ ] Ask 3–5 former UN/NGO colleagues to endorse your top skills (a quick LinkedIn message is enough)

### Step 1.6: Profile Photo & Banner
- [ ] Use a professional headshot (your current one from the website looks good)
- [ ] Create a banner image (1584 x 396 px) using Canva:
  - Include: A3DI logo + tagline ("Better results through data") + www.a3di.dev
  - Keep it clean and simple — dark background with light text works well
  - Free Canva template search: "LinkedIn banner minimalist consultant"

### Step 1.7: Profile Settings
- [ ] Turn on **Creator Mode** (Profile → "Creator mode" toggle)
  - This moves your "Featured" and "Activity" sections above "Experience" — better for marketing
  - Lets you add up to 5 topic hashtags to your profile
  - Add: #HumanitarianData, #MonitoringAndEvaluation, #DataForDevelopment, #SurveyDesign, #FoodSecurity
- [ ] Set your profile to **public** (Settings → Visibility)
- [ ] Customise your profile URL: linkedin.com/in/aaronwise (or similar — claim it if available)

**Estimated time for Phase 1: 1.5–2 hours (one-time)**

---

## Phase 2: Create the A3DI Company Page (Week 1–2)

This is a supporting asset, not your main channel. Spend 30 minutes here, max.

### Step 2.1: Create the Page
- [ ] Go to **linkedin.com/company/setup/new/**
- [ ] Select **"Small business"**
- [ ] Fill in:
  - **Name:** A3DI
  - **Public URL:** linkedin.com/company/a3di
  - **Website:** https://www.a3di.dev
  - **Industry:** International Trade and Development
  - **Company size:** 2–10 employees (looks slightly more established than "1")
  - **Type:** Privately Held

### Step 2.2: Complete the Page Profile
- [ ] **Logo:** Upload your A3DI logo (300 x 300 px)
- [ ] **Cover image:** Same banner as your personal profile or a variant (1128 x 191 px)
- [ ] **Tagline (120 chars):**

> Helping development & humanitarian organisations turn data into actionable insights

- [ ] **About section (max 2,000 chars):**

> A3DI (Advanced Analytics for Actionable Development Insights) supports UN agencies, NGOs, and development organisations across the full evidence pathway — from survey design and data collection through to analysis, visualisation, and capacity building.
>
> Founded by Aaron Wise, A3DI brings 15 years of hands-on experience working with humanitarian and development programmes in Africa and Asia. We specialise in food security, nutrition, and social protection data — helping organisations build the evidence base they need to improve programme design and meet their commitments to the communities they serve.
>
> Services:
> — Survey design and implementation
> — Data analysis, management, and automated pipelines
> — Dashboards and reporting (Tableau, PowerBI)
> — Training and capacity transfer
>
> www.a3di.dev

- [ ] **Locations:** Add your location
- [ ] **Specialties:** Data Analysis, Survey Design, Monitoring and Evaluation, Humanitarian Data, Food Security, Capacity Building, Data Visualisation

### Step 2.3: Link Everything Together
- [ ] Go back to your personal profile → Experience → A3DI role → Edit
- [ ] In the "Company" field, search for and select your new A3DI company page (this links them — your profile will now show the A3DI logo)
- [ ] Verify: your personal profile should now show the A3DI logo next to the role

### Step 2.4: Make a First Post on the Company Page
- [ ] Post a simple launch announcement:

> A3DI helps development and humanitarian organisations make better use of their data — from survey design to automated pipelines and dashboards. Learn more at www.a3di.dev

- [ ] This just makes the page look alive. Don't stress about it.

**Estimated time for Phase 2: 30–45 minutes (one-time)**

## Phase 3: Content & Engagement Rhythm (Week 2 onward)

### Step 3.1: Set Up Your Tooling
- [ ] Sign up for **Buffer** ($6/mo) at buffer.com — connect your personal LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Set up **Calendly** ($12/mo) for "30-min A3DI Consultation" meetings
  - Restrict availability to evenings and weekends (or times that work around your university schedule)
  - Add the Calendly link to your LinkedIn About section and A3DI website
- [ ] Sign up for **Canva Pro** ($13/mo) if you want to make carousels (free tier works too)

### Step 3.2: Build Your Network (Ongoing — 10 min/day)
- [ ] Connect with 5–10 people per week in your target audience:
  - Former UN/NGO colleagues
  - M&E officers at WFP, UNICEF, FAO, OCHA
  - People who engage with sector content (check who comments on ALNAP, CaLP, MERL Tech posts)
- [ ] When connecting, add a **brief personal note** — don't use the default:

> Hi [Name], I've been following [org]'s work on [topic]. I work on humanitarian data projects and would love to connect.

- [ ] Follow key organisational pages: WFP, UNICEF, OCHA, FAO, ALNAP, CaLP, MERL Tech, Devex
- [ ] **Engage daily (10 min):** Comment on 2–3 posts from sector peers or organisations. Add a substantive observation, not just "Great post!" This is the highest-ROI activity on LinkedIn — it puts your name and headline in front of other people's audiences.

### Step 3.3: Monthly Content Cadence
Using your `a3di-marketing` repo workflow:

| Week | Activity | Time | How |
|------|----------|------|-----|
| Week 1 | Insight post #1 | 25 min | `make draft` → bullet points → `make generate` → edit → Buffer |
| Week 2 | Engage only (comments) | 10 min/day | No post this week |
| Week 3 | Insight post #2 or carousel | 25–90 min | Same workflow; carousels take longer (use Canva) |
| Week 4 | Reshare to A3DI page + engage | 5 min | Reshare your best post from the month to the company page |

**That's it. 2–3 posts per month from your personal profile.** Don't overthink frequency — consistency beats volume.

### Step 3.4: Scheduling Around Your Day Job
- [ ] **Batch content creation:** Dedicate 1 evening per month (or a weekend morning) to draft all posts for the month. Use the repo workflow to generate drafts from bullet points.
- [ ] **Schedule via Buffer:** Queue posts for Tuesday–Thursday at 7:00–8:00 AM UTC (catches European and African mornings, which is your primary audience timezone). You'll never need to post live during work hours.
- [ ] **Daily engagement (10 min):** Do this during lunch, commute, or evening. Comment from your phone using the LinkedIn app. This looks indistinguishable from normal LinkedIn browsing.

## Phase 4: Social Proof Build-Out (Month 1–2)

### Step 4.1: Formalise Case Studies
- [ ] Pick 2 past projects (anonymise client names if needed)
- [ ] Use the case study template from your repo: `content/case-studies/TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Structure: Challenge → Approach → Result (one page each)
- [ ] Export as PDFs and add to:
  - Your LinkedIn Featured section
  - The A3DI Company Page (as a post with the PDF attached)
  - Your website (a3di.dev)

### Step 4.2: Collect Testimonials
- [ ] Email 2–3 former clients or collaborators with this template:

> Hi [Name], I hope you're well. I'm building out my consultancy profile for A3DI and wondering if you'd be willing to provide a short testimonial (2–3 sentences) about our work together on [project]. Happy to draft something for your approval if that's easier. Thanks!

- [ ] Add testimonials to:
  - Your LinkedIn About section (as quotes)
  - The A3DI website
  - Case study PDFs (as a pull quote)

### Step 4.3: Request LinkedIn Recommendations
- [ ] Go to your profile → Recommendations → "Ask for a recommendation"
- [ ] Request from 2–3 former managers or close collaborators at UN/NGO roles
- [ ] These show on your profile permanently and carry significant weight

---

## Phase 5: Ongoing Optimisation (Month 3+)

### Step 5.1: Track What Works
- [ ] Check LinkedIn analytics weekly (Profile → Analytics):
  - Which posts got the most impressions and engagement?
  - What topics resonate? What falls flat?
  - Where are your profile viewers from? (orgs, titles, locations)
- [ ] Log insights in `data/analytics/` in your repo

### Step 5.2: Double Down on Winners
- [ ] If a post topic gets strong engagement, create a follow-up post or carousel that goes deeper
- [ ] If a particular format works (e.g., "lesson from the field" stories), make that your default

### Step 5.3: Consider LinkedIn Newsletter (Month 4–6)
- [ ] Once you have 500+ followers and consistent posting, explore LinkedIn Newsletters
- [ ] Newsletters send push notifications to all followers — exceptional organic reach
- [ ] Monthly cadence is fine (e.g., "Data from the Field" — a monthly roundup of insights)
- [ ] This can replace the need for a separate email newsletter tool entirely
