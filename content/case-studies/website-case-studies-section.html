                    <div class="case-study-body">
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Alive &amp; Thrive needed to know whether 20 years of progress in
                            maternal and child health and nutrition was reaching the most vulnerable populations across
                            Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. But the data sat in 15+ survey rounds with
                            inconsistent structures.</p>
                        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> A3DI built a reproducible, configuration-driven Python pipeline
                            to harmonize MICS and DHS data across all three countries. JSON config files standardised
                            variables, so the same code processed every country-year combination. The pipeline computed
                            MCHN indicators for health services and infant feeding, applied survey weights, and produced
                            disaggregated analysis by wealth, ethnicity, geography, and education.</p>
                        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The analysis revealed that while overall indicators had improved,
                            progress was deeply uneven. Wealth-driven disparities persisted, ethnic and regional gaps
                            exceeded 35 percentage points in Lao PDR, and health service quality lagged behind access.
                            A&amp;T used the findings for country strategies, donor advocacy, and regional knowledge
                            products. The pipeline was designed as a reusable asset, extensible to new countries and
                            survey rounds.</p>
