## About Section

```
I help development and humanitarian organisations turn programme data into clear, actionable insights — from survey design through to automated pipelines and dashboards.

Over 15+ years, I've worked primarily with WFP and UNICEF across more than a dozen countries in Asia and Africa. My work has spanned acute food security analysis (including IPC inputs), mVAM remote monitoring system design, national food security surveys, nutrition surveillance, and social protection targeting. I've led data work in both stable development contexts and active emergencies — from Typhoon Haiyan response in the Philippines to COVID-19 remote assessments across the Pacific.

More recently, I've focused on building the technical infrastructure behind these programmes: Python-based data pipelines, automated reporting systems, and reproducible analysis workflows that help organisations maintain their evidence base long after a consultancy ends.

Through A3DI, I offer hands-on support across the full evidence pathway:

→ Survey design and implementation (paper, tablet, phone-based, web)
→ Data analysis, cleaning pipelines, and management systems (Python, R, SQL, PostgreSQL)
→ Dashboards and reporting (Tableau, PowerBI)
→ Training and capacity transfer for M&E and data teams

I also hold an MPH from Tulane (International Health & Nutrition) and am completing a BS in Computer Science at Oregon State, which keeps my software engineering skills sharp alongside the domain expertise.

If your organisation needs practical, field-tested data support, I'd welcome a conversation.

**Length:** ~1,500 characters (well within the 2,600 limit)

**Notes:**
- The CS degree is worth mentioning — it signals that your technical skills are current and deepening, not legacy. It also differentiates you from traditional M&E consultants.
- The arrows (→) render well on LinkedIn and break up the wall of text.

## Profile Settings Checklist

- [ ] Set profile to public
- [ ] Customise URL to: linkedin.com/in/aaronbwise (you may already have this)

## What NOT to include on LinkedIn

- **The university-focused CV summary** ("Currently relocating to Gainesville, FL and seeking to apply data management skills in an academic research environment") — this is for job applications, not your LinkedIn profile which should sell A3DI
- **Every short-term engagement as a separate entry** — consolidated entries tell a stronger story
- **The detailed skills matrix from the university CV** ("Proactive task management", "Attention to detail", "End-user support") — these are resume keywords, not LinkedIn content
- **MS Access** — unless it's genuinely relevant to your audience; Python/PostgreSQL tells a more modern story

---

## A note on the two CV versions

You effectively have two professional identities right now, and that's completely fine:

**University CV:** Emphasises database management, research support, MS Access, longitudinal studies. Written for academic hiring managers. Keep this version for university/academic applications.

**A3DI / LinkedIn:** Emphasises food security expertise, automated pipelines, humanitarian field experience, survey design. Written for M&E officers and programme managers at UN/NGOs. This is your public brand.

LinkedIn should reflect the A3DI identity. Your university CV lives on applications and job boards, not on your public profile.
