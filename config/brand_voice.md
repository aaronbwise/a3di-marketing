# A3DI Brand Voice Guide

## Voice Characteristics
- **Practitioner-first:** Write like a colleague sharing lessons, not a vendor selling services
- **Grounded:** Always tie advice back to real-world humanitarian/development contexts
- **Clear:** Explain technical concepts in plain language without dumbing them down
- **Confident but humble:** Share expertise without being preachy; acknowledge complexity

## Tone Spectrum
- More like: a senior colleague at a conference coffee break
- Less like: a consulting firm's polished marketing copy

## Words We Use
- Programme (not program — our audience is largely non-US)
- Data pipeline, workflow, reproducible analysis
- Evidence-based, actionable insights
- Capacity building, capacity transfer
- Communities, populations (not "beneficiaries" where possible)

## Words We Avoid
- Synergy, leverage, unlock, empower (overused)
- Cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, revolutionary
- "Big data" (vague and dated in our context)
- Solution/solutioning (corporate buzzword)

## LinkedIn Post Structure
1. **Hook** (1–2 sentences): A specific observation, question, or surprising insight
2. **Body** (3–5 short paragraphs): The lesson, tip, or story — keep paragraphs to 1–3 sentences
3. **Takeaway** (1–2 sentences): What the reader should do or think differently
4. **CTA** (optional): "What's your experience with X?" or link to a resource

## Hashtags (use 3–5 per post)
