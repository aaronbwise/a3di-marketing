**Marketing Plan 2026**

Inbound Lead Generation & Thought Leadership Strategy

Prepared: February 2026

www.a3di.dev

1\. Executive Summary

This marketing plan is designed for A3DI, a solo consultancy
specializing in data services for humanitarian and development
organizations. The plan focuses on two primary goals: generating inbound
leads and building thought leadership within the international
development data space. It is built around a low-effort content
approach, a modest monthly budget of \$100--500, and strategic use of
LinkedIn, conference speaking, and partnership channels.

The plan leverages Aaron Wise's 15 years of domain expertise as the core
differentiator, turning real project experience into lightweight,
high-impact content that positions A3DI as the go-to expert for
data-driven programme improvement in the humanitarian sector.

2\. Situation Analysis

2.1 Strengths

-   Deep domain expertise: 15 years across UN agencies and NGOs in
    Africa and Asia

-   Full evidence-pathway offering: survey design through to dashboards
    and training

-   Niche positioning: development/humanitarian data is underserved by
    generalist consultancies

-   Technical credibility: automated pipelines, Tableau/PowerBI,
    reproducible analysis

2.2 Opportunities

-   Growing demand for M&E data services as donors increase
    accountability requirements

-   AI/automation interest in the sector creates demand for modernized
    data workflows

-   Few competitors combine deep humanitarian field experience with
    technical data skills

-   Existing informal case studies can be formalized into powerful
    marketing assets

2.3 Challenges

-   Solo operator: limited time for marketing alongside billable work

-   Modest budget constrains paid advertising options

-   Long sales cycles typical in institutional/NGO procurement

-   Website currently lacks social proof (testimonials, case studies,
    logos)

3\. Target Audience

A3DI's ideal clients fall into three primary segments, each with
distinct decision-making patterns and pain points:

  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

4\. Positioning & Messaging

4.1 Core Positioning Statement

> *A3DI helps development and humanitarian organisations turn messy
> programme data into clear, actionable insights---from survey design to
> dashboards---so they can make better decisions for the communities
> they serve.*

4.2 Key Messages by Audience

-   **For M&E teams:** "We handle the data pipeline so you can focus on
    programmes."

-   **For leadership:** "Evidence-based decisions that satisfy donors
    and improve outcomes."

-   **For procurement:** "15 years of field-tested methods across Africa
    and Asia, with UN and NGO references."

4.3 Differentiators to Emphasize

-   Field experience + technical depth (not just a data scientist, not
    just an aid worker)

-   End-to-end service across the full evidence pathway

-   Capacity transfer: A3DI builds your team's skills, not just
    deliverables

-   Sector-specific: understands food security, nutrition, and social
    protection data

5\. Channel Strategy

The strategy focuses on three high-ROI channels suited to a solo
consultancy with limited time and a \$100--500/month budget. The
emphasis is on low-effort, high-leverage activities.

5.1 LinkedIn (Primary Channel)

**Goal:** Build visibility among development/humanitarian professionals
and generate inbound inquiries.

  ----------------- -------------------------- --------------- -------------
  **Activity**      **Description**            **Frequency**   **Effort**

                    words) sharing a lesson,                   each)
                    tip, or observation from                   
                    real project work. No full                 
                    articles needed.                           

  Carousel Posts    Visual slide decks (5--7   1x per month    Medium
                    slides) on topics like "5                  (\~1--2 hrs)
                    Survey Design Mistakes in                  
                    Humanitarian Assessments"

                    sector peers. React and                    
                    add value.                                 

  Profile           Headline rewrite, featured One-time        Low (\~1 hr)

                    filled in.                                 
  ----------------- -------------------------- --------------- -------------

Automation tip: Use a scheduling tool like Buffer (\$6/mo) to batch and
schedule posts. Draft 4--6 posts in a single sitting once per month.

5.2 Conference Speaking & Webinars

**Goal:** Position Aaron as a recognized expert and generate warm leads
through direct audience engagement.

  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

                                                  challenges.
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

5.3 Partnerships & Network Referrals

**Goal:** Tap into existing trust networks within the
humanitarian/development ecosystem for warm introductions and
subcontracting opportunities.

-   Identify 5--10 complementary consultants (qualitative researchers,
    sector specialists) for mutual referrals

-   Reach out to UN framework agreement holders who subcontract data/M&E
    work

-   Join or become active in MERL Tech, CaLP, and ALNAP communities

-   Offer co-branded webinars or joint proposals with partner
    organizations

-   Create a simple one-page "Partner Brief" PDF summarizing A3DI's
    services for easy forwarding

6\. Content Strategy (Low-Effort Approach)

Given the preference for minimal content overhead, the strategy focuses
on repurposing real work into marketing assets with minimal additional
writing.

6.1 Content Pillars

  ----------------- -------------------------- --------------------------
  **Pillar**        **Topics**                 **Format**

  Lessons from the  What went wrong/right on a LinkedIn posts, conference
  Field             real project (anonymized). talks
                    Practical tips for M&E     
                    teams.                     

  Data Methods Made Explaining statistical     LinkedIn carousels,
  Simple            methods, pipeline design,  webinars
                    or dashboard best          
                    practices in plain         
                    language.                  

  Sector Trends &   Reacting to new            Short LinkedIn posts
  Commentary        guidelines, donor          
                    requirements, or sector    
                    reports with a data        
                    perspective.               

  Case Studies      One-page summaries of past PDF on website + LinkedIn
                    projects: challenge,       featured
                    approach, result.          
  ----------------- -------------------------- --------------------------

6.2 AI-Assisted Content Workflow

To minimize effort, use the following workflow for each piece of
content:

-   **Step 1 -- Capture:** After each project milestone, jot down 3--5
    bullet points about what was interesting or challenging (5 min).

-   **Step 2 -- Draft:** Feed the bullets into Claude or ChatGPT with
    your brand voice guidelines to generate a LinkedIn post draft (5
    min).

-   **Step 3 -- Edit & Post:** Refine the draft in your own voice, add a
    personal anecdote, and schedule via Buffer (10--15 min).

Total time per post: \~20--25 minutes. This workflow also works for
generating case study drafts and webinar outlines.

7\. Website Improvements

The current site at www.a3di.dev is clean but lacks conversion elements.
These high-impact, low-effort improvements are recommended:

11\. Summary

This plan is designed to be sustainable for a solo operator. The core
idea is simple: leverage 15 years of real-world expertise as the content
engine, use AI tools to minimize production time, and focus on the three
channels where humanitarian/development decision-makers actually spend
their time---LinkedIn, conferences, and trusted peer networks.

The most important near-term action is formalizing existing case studies
and testimonials. Social proof is the single highest-converting asset
for a consultancy, and A3DI already has the raw material from years of
work. Everything else builds on that foundation.

The plan should be revisited quarterly to assess which activities are
generating leads and which can be dropped or adjusted.
