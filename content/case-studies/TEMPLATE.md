# [Project Title]

## Challenge

<!-- 2-3 sentences: What problem did the client face? Focus on the organisational
pain point (reporting delays, data quality gaps, capacity limitations) not the
technical details. Anonymise by default: "a UN agency in East Africa" is fine. -->



## Approach

<!-- 3-5 sentences: What did A3DI do? Be specific about methods and tools.
Example: "Designed a mobile data collection system using ODK, built an automated
cleaning pipeline in Python, and developed a Tableau dashboard for real-time
monitoring." -->



## Result

<!-- 2-3 sentences: What changed? Quantify where possible:
- Time saved (e.g., "reduced reporting cycle from 3 weeks to 2 days")
- Coverage (e.g., "scaled from 3 to 12 regions")
- Capacity (e.g., "trained 15 staff to maintain the pipeline independently")
If you can't quantify, describe the qualitative outcome. -->



## Key Takeaway

<!-- 1 sentence: The generalizable lesson. This is what makes the case study
useful content — it gives the reader something they can apply to their own work. -->
