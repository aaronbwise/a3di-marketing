National averages can tell a misleading story.

When Alive & Thrive needed to understand how maternal and child health and nutrition had changed across Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, the headline numbers showed progress. But they needed to know: progress for whom?

I built a reproducible Python pipeline to harmonize 15+ rounds of MICS and DHS survey data spanning over 20 years. It standardised variable names, merged household and individual records, and computed MCHN indicators across every country-year combination. The configuration-driven design meant adding a new country or survey round required a new config file, not new code.

The disaggregated analysis (by wealth, ethnicity, geography, education) told a different story. Overall indicators had improved, but progress was deeply uneven. Wealth-driven disparities persisted, and in some cases ethnic and regional gaps exceeded 35 percentage points. Health service access had expanded, but quality of care had barely moved.

A&T used the findings for country strategies, donor advocacy, and knowledge products across the region.

The takeaway: if your programme is tracking national averages, you might be missing the people who need you most. Disaggregated, reproducible analysis is how you find them.

What's your experience with equity analysis in your programmes?
